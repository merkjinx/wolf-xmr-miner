Wolf's OpenCL XMR Miner for AMD GPUs

If you get an error about `clCreateBuffer`, lower your `rawintensity`. See the example config [xmr.conf](xmr.conf) for details.

Generally, you want to raise `rawintensity` as high as it will go without error - but remember, 2MiB of GPU RAM is needed for every work-item.

The GPU fan, powertune, and clock setting options are accepted, as the configuration routine was ripped from my own full-custom miner, but they do nothing.

# hyc's additions (Linux only)

Use a GPU index of `-1` to run on the CPU. The only other config item needed is "threads",
but `rawintensity` and `worksize` must still be set to a non-zero value.

As with the original CPU miner, you can gain a performance boost by configuring huge pages.
Check current setting with `sysctl vm.nr_hugepages` then set it to at least 3 times the
total number of threads you're using, as root.

    sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=num

Also, it can run faster as root, which allows it to use mlock.

# Solo mining

Use a URL of "daemon+tcp://<host>:<port>" - requires bitmonerod v0.9.3.1 or newer
